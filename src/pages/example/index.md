### Aldous Huxley

- Facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored.

- Words can be like X-rays if you use them properly -- they’ll go through
  anything. You read and you’re pierced.

- After silence, that which comes nearest to expressing the inexpressible is
  music.

- But I don't want comfort. I want God, I want poetry, I want real danger, I
  want freedom, I want goodness. I want sin.

- You shall know the truth and the truth shall make you mad.

- Maybe this world is another planet’s hell.

- The more powerful and original a mind, the more it will incline towards the
  religion of solitude.
